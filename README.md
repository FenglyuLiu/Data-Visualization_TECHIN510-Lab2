# TECHIN510-Lab2: Introduction to Data Visualization with Streamlit

## Introduction

This lab focuses on creating a simple web app using Streamlit to visualize data from a dataset.

## How to Run

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv

2. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py

## What's Included

- `app.py`: The main Python file that contains the Streamlit app code.
- `requirements.txt`: A file that lists the Python dependencies required to run the app.
- `data/`: A directory that contains the dataset(s) used for visualization.

## Lessons Learned

- How to set up and use a virtual environment in Python.
- Basics of using Streamlit to create interactive web apps.
- Implementing different types of data visualizations with Streamlit.
